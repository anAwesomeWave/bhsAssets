# bhsAssets

## üìñ About
This repository contains the backend code for the BHS marketplace, written in Go. It provides a web application to manage and trade assets on the marketplace.

**!Note - jwt secret is public, should be changed in production!**
## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites
Ensure the following prerequisites are installed on your system:
1. **Docker**  
   Verify the installation:
   ```bash
   docker -v
   ```

2. **GNU Make**  
   Verify the installation:
   ```bash
   make -v
   ```

## üì¶ Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone this repository from GitHub:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:anAwesomeWave/bhsAssets.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   ```bash
   cd bhsAssets
   ```

## üí° Quickstart
You have several options to start the application (you may need to run some commands with `sudo`):

- **Launch the Entire Infrastructure**  
  This will start the database, apply migrations, build a project image, and run the binary file:
  ```bash
  make up
  ```

- **Launch Database and Apply Migrations**  
  Note: Use external ports to connect to the database on your host system.
  - Use port `5432` for the PostgreSQL database running in Docker.
  - Use port `54321` for a database running on the host system.
  ```bash
  make dev
  go build ./cmd/app
  ./app -v
  ```

- **Test the System**
  ```bash
  make test
  ```

- **Stop the System**
  ```bash
  make down
  ```
  *(Optional) Clear the Docker build cache (see Issues & Peculiarities).*

> **Tip:** Check other options in the Makefile.

## üöß Issues & Peculiarities
1. **Docker Build Cache Issues**  
   The app may  work poorly with the Docker build cache. You may want to check the cache size:
   ```bash
   docker system df
   ```
   And clean the cache if necessary:
   ```bash
   docker buildx prune -f
   ```

2. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**  
   While efforts have been made to maintain cross-platform support, the application works best on Linux.

1. **API Support Improvements** ‚úîÔ∏è  
   Improve support for the API and ensure it functions correctly.

2. **Add user's page**  
   Add a user page with information about the user and all the resources created by him.

3. **Jwt token expiration**  
   Add user's token expiration after generating new one for him.

4. **Testing**  
   Cover the code with unit and functional tests.

5. **Documentation**  
   Generate Swagger/OpenAPI documentation. Currently, the API documentation is difficult to maintain as it is comment-based instead of code-based.
